# DragonPower 1.0

This is a game based on FlappyBird, inspired by Dragon Ball Series.
We've developed this game in a week working 2 hours per day, as part of our JAVA programming bootcamp.

We still plan to improve the game, by restarting the project using libgdx.For this specific project we used only a SimpleGraphics library.
We had to build our very own Physics Engine, which was somehting quite cool.

The game has a major bug, which we are not fixing since we plan to redo-it.
The bug is as follows:
  -When we get Game Over, if we restart the game by pressing the Space bar, the game will gradually becomme slower.
  -More times we do that, the slower it gets.
  

If you have any questions or suggestions please don't hesitate to ask.

Peace!
